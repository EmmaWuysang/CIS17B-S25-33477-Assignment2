# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment2

I created this program using **NetBeans IDE.**
It should run perfectly fine, and the files are all already connected to each other. I used the singleton method with one instance of library!

**I will also upload pictures of the program running in case.**
I implemented a random number generator here as well, there are a few things I did that were purely stylistic along with tad bit comments and notes.
I also went through commenting most operations/parts.
Files will be in a folder.
**Download & run in your selected IDE, NetBeans preferred as I am not completely positive how this works in other IDE's, regardless the process should be similar.**
